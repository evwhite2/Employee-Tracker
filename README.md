# Employee-Tracker
Content Management System for an employee database

Notes for future development:

1. There are a few query strings that could be cleaned up, mainly the long string used to display all textual information as seen in when the user chooses to "view all employees".
2. I have some starter code which I was trying to use to define a list of employees to populate an inquirer "list" of "choices". This would allow user to scroll through all employees and to manage database in a more interactive way.
    - This code, once I have it figured out, could also be applied throughout the "manage.js" file in various ways to make the application function more smoothly althogether. 
3. Of course, an HR application would work best if it was deployed as a front-end application, and therefore a front end piece would need to be created in the future.
